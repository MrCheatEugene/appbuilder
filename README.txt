A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.

Demo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
you can use for pretty much whatever.

(* = Were not included, but now they are)

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :) // Send them not to here, but to Alpha template's author(contacts below)
